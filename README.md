# with debug information 
python offlinespeedcams.py --debug SpeedCamText.txt

# 'type' translator
python offlinespeedcams.py --debug --igotypes 1=1,2=1,3=1,4=1,5=9,7=9 speedcam_EU.txt
```


## FAQ

**What for is a --igotypes switch?**

Hmm... difficult question... So...

Igo types of speed camera:
```
1 - fixed speed camera locations
2 - combined red light and speed cameras
3 - fixed red light camera locations 
4 - section camera positions
5 - lasers, hand-held radars and other mobile speed camera locations 
6 - railway crossing
7 - not constant mobile locations
```

In Sygic column 'Type' in table 'OfflineSpeedcam' is equivalent to speedCamWarn{Type} in TTS info2.ini (Type: 9 = speedCamWarn9):
```
/Android/data/com.sygic.aura/files/Res/tts_info/TTS {YOUR LANGUAGE}/info2.ini
```

For example ENG TTS:
```
/Android/data/com.sygic.aura/files/Res/tts_info/TTS British English/info2.ini

[TRANSLATIONS]
...
speedCamWarn1=Speed camera is ahead.
speedCamWarn9=Police is ahead.
speedCamWarn16=Schoolzone is ahead.
speedCamWarn15=Closure is ahead.
speedCamWarn12=Traffic is ahead.
speedCamWarn11=Accident is ahead.
...
```

You can change it to:
```
speedCamWarn1=Speed camera is %DISTANCE% ahead.
speedCamWarn2=Red light and speed camera is %DISTANCE% ahead.
speedCamWarn3=Red light camera is %DISTANCE% ahead.
speedCamWarn4=Section camera is %DISTANCE% ahead.
speedCamWarn5=Mobile speed camera is %DISTANCE% ahead.
speedCamWarn6=Railway crossing is %DISTANCE% ahead.
speedCamWarn7=Mobile speed camera could be %DISTANCE% ahead.
speedCamWarn9=Police is %DISTANCE% ahead.
speedCamWarn16=Schoolzone is %DISTANCE% ahead.
speedCamWarn15=Closure is %DISTANCE% ahead.
speedCamWarn12=Traffic is %DISTANCE% ahead.
speedCamWarn11=Accident is %DISTANCE% ahead.
```

And convert points like this:
```
python offlinespeedcams.py --igotypes 1=1,2=2,3=3,4=4,5=5,6=6,7=7 SpeedCamText.txt
```

Defects of this solution:

* If you are use 'Advanced Voice' - you will not see anything (icon/symbol), for non standard warnings (form 2 to 7). If you want see icons for types between 2 and 9, you must add them as [POI](https://www.sygic.com/pl/company/poi), but .rupi must be separately for each country ;( 
* If you use 'Standard Voice' - you will not see and hear anything, for non standard warnings (form 2 to 7) 


Another examples:
```
# import all types as standard speed camera, but omit railway crossing (6)
python offlinespeedcams.py --igotypes 1=1,2=1,3=1,4=1,5=1,7=1 SpeedCamText.txt
```

**What with Angle, BothWays and Osm?**

I did not want to risk that something will not show up, so: 
* Angle is always Null = all directions (360)
* BothWays is always 1 = true
* Osm is always 0 = false, because i don't know what for it is ...

**I can't hear the speed of speed camera**

At this moment (v 17.2.11) Sygic cannot speak maximum speed of speed camera ;( maybe in future...

**What when I not use origin offlinespeedcams.dat from Sygic?**

The script will create empty database, but table OfflineZone will be empty ;( and you loose 'sygic' records from OfflineSpeedcam.
